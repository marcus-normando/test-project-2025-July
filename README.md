# My Atomic Design To-Do List

Hi! I'm Marcus, and this is my take on a modern to-do list app. I built it for a coding test to demonstrate my skills with React, TypeScript, and Atomic Design. My focus was on clean code, a smooth user experience, and a structure that's easy to maintain and extend.

## Why Atomic Design?
I wanted to try the Atomic Design methodology to keep my components organized and reusable. It made it much easier to manage styles and logic as the app grew.

## Features
- Add, complete, edit, and remove tasks
- Remove all completed tasks
- Responsive design with subtle animations
- Local storage for persistence
- Accessible and keyboard-friendly

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Run tests: `npm test`


Thanks for checking out my project!
